    "description": "When a grieving cab driver unearths a golden artefact in the Wiltshire countryside, his discovery sets off a chain of events linking him to Bibi, a young journalist chasing a royal mystery buried since King Alfred’s reign. As their search moves between medieval archives and modern corruption, they uncover a story of betrayal and redemption that spans centuries. Both must decide how much truth they are willing to expose—and what it will cost them. A literary thriller that fuses emotional depth with historical intrigue, The Broken Crown explores how the past refuses to stay buried.",

    "engagement": "High reader engagement potential across historical and mystery audiences",
    "keyCharacteristics": "Culturally literate adult readers aged 30–55 with a strong interest in British history, dual-timeline mysteries, and emotionally resonant fiction. The readership spans established historical fiction fans and upmarket thriller readers drawn to intellectual intrigue and human drama.",
    "detailedAnalysis": "The novel’s thematic blend of loss, discovery, and historical revelation resonates with a readership split between thoughtful women readers of historical fiction and globally dispersed mystery enthusiasts. The inclusion of a Black female journalist protagonist expands the book’s appeal to readers seeking inclusive representation and depth in character-driven suspense. Market research indicates strong alignment with communities engaged in book clubs, heritage literature, and online historical fiction networks, with crossover appeal to audiobook and digital-first consumers."

    "readership": "The core audience includes mature, educated readers who favour emotionally intelligent mysteries and stories that illuminate personal and national history. They seek literary depth without sacrificing narrative drive and are receptive to layered emotional arcs and morally complex protagonists.",
    "classification": "The book sits within a bespoke subgenre taxonomy that bridges the emotional weight of literary fiction with the propulsion of a historical thriller. It combines the investigative curiosity of treasure hunt fiction, the sensitivity of grief-centred narratives, and the authenticity of archaeological adventure. Positioned between mass-market historical thrillers and reflective literary works, it offers a hybrid form ideal for both book clubs and critical readerships.",
    "personas": "Rachel Montgomery, the primary persona, exemplifies the book’s target readership—a historically engaged, empathetic woman who values authenticity, depth, and emotional truth in fiction. Her response to stories that intertwine human legacy with discovery mirrors the book’s emotional purpose. Secondary personas, such as the analytical reader Marcus Tanaka, broaden its appeal across professional, globally connected readers who value intellectual tension and ethical storytelling.",
    "marketingGuidance": "The marketing insights provide clear pathways for shaping first-stage campaign strategy. They emphasise positioning the book as a cross-era literary thriller that humanises history through emotional investigation. Campaign hooks should highlight its dual timelines, the contrast between heritage and modern corruption, and the emotional journey of recovery through truth. These insights serve as a practical guide for ad copy, visuals, and tone. In future, this framework will evolve into a standalone marketing product, but for now forms an integral component of the report’s first release."

Vivid landscapes and eerie monastic relics heighten the sensory atmosphere, while the romantic subplot provides moments of warmth.
