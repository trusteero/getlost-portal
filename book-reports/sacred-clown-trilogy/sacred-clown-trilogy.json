    "author": "Richard A. Voorhees",
    "emoji": "🤡",
    "subtitle": "A satirical, myth-infused reimagining of the Western",
    "description": "A genre-blurring trilogy that fuses Indigenous myth, political satire, and frontier landscapes. From the Dakota plains to the Amazon rainforest, gods and mortals collide in a biting, irreverent narrative that skewers colonial legacies, ecological exploitation, and bureaucratic absurdity. Both sharp-witted and deeply resonant, it offers readers a story that is as entertaining as it is unsettling.",

    "readership": "The readership is urban, globally distributed, and highly educated, with strong representation among academics, activists, and cultural commentators. These readers favour trade paperbacks, audiobooks, and ebooks, often discover titles via critical reviews, podcasts, and indie bookstores, and gravitate toward fiction that combines sharp humour with cultural critique. Secondary readers come from eco-fiction, Western, and speculative circles, expanding the trilogy's crossover reach.",
    "classification": "The trilogy is positioned at the crossroads of literary Western, Indigenous fiction, satire, and eco-fiction. Using a bespoke taxonomy of subgenres, it lands squarely in the emerging space of Indigenous and eco-Westerns with satirical resonance, offering a rare blend of mythic imagination, frontier iconography, and political sharpness.",
    "personas": "Two key personas capture the readership: Daniel the Cultural Critic and Sofia the Ecological Story-Seeker. Daniel represents the intellectual reader seeking satire and cultural critique, while Sofia embodies the eco-conscious, globally minded reader drawn to myth and environmental themes. Daniel’s profile is especially central, reflecting the book’s strongest alignment with politically engaged, literary audiences.",
    "marketingGuidance": "The marketing insights highlight opportunities to position the trilogy as both provocative and accessible, weaving together satire, myth, and cultural commentary. Copy and creative hooks can focus on irreverence, frontier myth, and ecological urgency. This early-stage guidance will help shape launch campaigns and provide the foundation for a fuller standalone marketing product in future iterations."
